# CI/CD + Cloudflare Workflow

- **Deploy:** Push to main triggers deploy. CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN required in GitHub Secrets.
- **R2 Backup:** Each deploy backs up to `meaux-builds-backups/ci/{repo}/`.
- **Secret handling:** Never commit tokens. Use env vars or GitHub Secrets only.
- **Multi-agent:** Cursor agents can run in parallel; changes should be merge-safe.
